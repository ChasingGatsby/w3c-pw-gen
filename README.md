# Weekly Challenge 3 - Password Generator
## Description
This week our homework assignment had us design JavaScript for a randomized password generator. The goal was to write code that, on a button click, would ask the user several questions about any criteria needed for the password, and produce a password that would meet the selected criteria.

I was a little worried when we started because I felt like I didn't really have all the tools I needed to know how to even start; and definitely for the first day or two of work I was pretty much at a loss. This was especially true for directly interfacing with the JavaScript via the HTML elements. A lot of that was particularly due to not having gone over the confirm(), alert(), and prompt() commands that were probably run through on the student project.

However, after that gap in knowledge was resolved, most everything else was easy to design. The most intensive part of the task was trying to randomize characters for each password, especially as I coded in a way that the final pool of valid characters was an array of arrays. Originally, I had tried to piecemeal a function using various concepts I found during my research; but I eventually scrapped that line of thought and decided to just design the function from scratch, which obviously worked out nicely.

All in all, it was a pretty tricky assignment that unexpectedly ended up testing my knowledge of the week's material. Much like my time learning HTML and CSS, understanding how functions not only work, but interact with each other made a lot more sense to me once I really understood the hierarchy and flow imposed by the scope of functions.
That understanding was really what pushed me through the rest of this project.
